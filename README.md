## Password Generator

This is a password generator that will create a random password based on the length of characters 
chosen by the user and the user's ability to choose from 4 different groups of characters.

Unfortuately, this current application has bugs and incomplete code that was not able to be overcome
by the deadline.
It will be resubmitted in the future once able to be completed.



I was fortunate to have some assistance from my tutor Frank Craven, Neil the learning Assistant and Laura Cole the TA.
